# Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction

Greetings, I'm Harpreet Singh, a Computer Science major at IIITH, finished my third semester. Having recently completed courses like CS3.301 (Operating Systems and Networks) and CS1.302 (Automata Theory), I find myself intrigued by the practical applications of Computer Science. Witnessing theories come to life in computer systems and algorithms has been truly captivating.


## What to Expect.
As someone with dynamic interests, my focus shifts based on current happenings. Primarily, my curiosity centers around the developments in the field of computer science.
So this is a place where I would not only share algorithms and data structure problems but also research articles in the tech domain. Rest assured, these articles won't be your typical run-of-the-mill readsâ€”they're designed to captivate and inspire ðŸ˜‰.

## Road Ahead

It's just the beginning, and I would keep updating my daily learnings, challenges, and discoveries regularly. I hope that, in turn, you find something new and interesting with each visit. I won't fail the people who give their extremely valuable time and attention on this page!

Thank you for stopping by, see you on the first post!
